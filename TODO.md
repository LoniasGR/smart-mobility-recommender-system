## TODO LIST

## Things we want to support

- Age (For example for older people scooter is a  no-go)
- Distance
- Capacity (Boats can fit 10 people)
- Maps

### Age

Age is a tricky question. How do we allow our recommendations to be inclusive, but also take into consideration age?

### Distance
 
  - I think we can start off with a fixed distance (i.e. scooter for up to 5km) and see what needs to be changed
  - Walking distance research
    - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920922000013
    - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377942/

### Capacity

Questions:
- Is there a timetable for the sea vessels?
- Do sea vessels have a fixed route?

Our assumption:
- Fixed timetable
- Fixed routes

### Maps

For maps, we can use something like [this API](https://openrouteservice.org/)

### Battery
